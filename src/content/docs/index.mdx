# About Me

Hi fellow dreamer, thanks for stopping by!

I am Sahil Arora, a software engineer and problem solver based out of India. I am an alumnus of [Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi](http://iitmandi.ac.in/), batch of 2018, and am currently working as a Senior Member of Technical Staff at ThoughtSpot, India, where I make observability better for developers.

Apart from work, I have been a part of the Open Source Developer Community and has been an active contributor to [OpenPrinting](https://openprinting.github.io/). I also implemented the first open source conversion tool of the PCLm format, enabling printers low on RAM to print large PDFs via [Wifi-Direct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Direct). I am really passionate about helping budding students and have been a mentor in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) and [iie WeTech](https://www.iie.org/Programs/WeTech) mentorship programs.

I really like food, and sometimes I think that's one of the key purposes of my life. Although I find it hard to balance between eating less and staying fit. I workout a lot as well. My reading speed is a bit slow though, and I have recently started reading more to learn more about life in general.

This website is made to encapsulate my thoughts and share them with the internet. You can also reach out to me on: [sight-cyclops.0a@icloud.com](mailto:sight-cyclops.0a@icloud.com).
