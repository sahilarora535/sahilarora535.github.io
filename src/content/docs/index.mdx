# About Me

I am Sahil Arora, a software engineer and problem solver based in India. A proud alumnus of the [Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi](http://iitmandi.ac.in/) (Batch of 2018), I currently work as a Senior Member of Technical Staff at ThoughtSpot, where I focus on enhancing developer observability.

Beyond my professional work, I have contributed to the open-source community, particularly with [OpenPrinting](https://openprinting.github.io/). A highlight of my contributions is the implementation of the first open-source conversion tool for the PCLm format, which enables low-memory printers to handle large PDF files seamlessly. I am also passionate about mentorship and have guided students through programs like [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) and [iie WeTech](https://www.iie.org/Programs/WeTech).

Outside of technology, I am a food enthusiast and an avid reader with a growing interest in personal development and life philosophy. I also enjoy the challenge of maintaining a balance between my culinary explorations and fitness goals.

This website is my space to share thoughts and experiences. Feel free to reach out to me at [sight-cyclops.0a@icloud.com](mailto:sight-cyclops.0a@icloud.com).
