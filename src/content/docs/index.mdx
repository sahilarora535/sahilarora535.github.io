# About Me

Hi fellow dreamer, thanks for stopping by!

I am Sahil Arora, a software engineer and problem solver based in India. I am an alumnus of [Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi](http://iitmandi.ac.in/), batch of 2018, and am currently working as a Senior Member of Technical Staff at ThoughtSpot, India, where I make observability better for developers.

Apart from work, I have been a part of the Open Source Developer Community and have been an active contributor to [OpenPrinting](https://openprinting.github.io/). I also implemented the first open source conversion tool for the PCLm format, enabling printers with low RAM to print large PDFs via [Wifi-Direct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Direct). I am really passionate about helping budding students and have been a mentor in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) and [iie WeTech](https://www.iie.org/Programs/WeTech) mentorship programs.

I really like food, and sometimes I think that's one of my hobbies. Although I find it hard to balance eating less and staying fit. I also like to read, my reading speed is a bit slow though, and I have recently started reading more about life in general.

This website is created to encapsulate my thoughts and share them on the internet. You can also reach out to me on: [sight-cyclops.0a@icloud.com](mailto:sight-cyclops.0a@icloud.com).
