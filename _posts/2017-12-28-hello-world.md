How could my first blog post have some other title than this. This is the de-facto `Lorem Ipsum` which starts one\'s journey as a programmer. ***Remember***, you have to start with **\"Hello, World!\"**.


{% highlight c++ %}
/**
 * First code snippet on {{ site.url }}
 * sahilarora535
 * 27-12-2017
 */ 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{	
	/* To get things going, remember, Hello, World! */
	cout << "Hello, World!\n";
	/* Now, I can put up my custom message */
	cout << "The 'Blog' page consists of all my blogs sorted in reverse chronological order.\n"
			 << "The site is also enabled with code highlighting and Disqus comments, "
			 << "so feel free to comment on any blog post, give up a suggestion, ask a question, "
			 << "or fire up a discussion of your choice.";
	return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Compile the code, run it, see the output (in case it\'s not pretty much obvious). 
I hope this website of mine helps someone at some point of time.
