As the ritual says, the first program should be a `Hello, World!` program in any programming language, so here goes my `Hello, World!` blog post, marking the initialization of my personal website. I really hope I keep sharing my thoughts and discoveries here and also learn on the way how to write great articles.

Here is a piece of code which compiles and prints a lovely message in [`Go`](https://go.dev). Try it out on the [`Go` Playground](https://play.golang.org/p/mAG4Gw0WawC).

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("{{ page.title }}")
}
```

Bella ciao!
