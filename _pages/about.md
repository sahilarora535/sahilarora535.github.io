Hi there! :)
I am Sahil Arora, an engineer and problem solver based out of India. I have completed my Bachelors in Technology majoring in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi](http://iitmandi.ac.in/) in the year 2018, and am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at Amazon Development Centre, India, where I make payments at Amazon better and faster for all its customers.

Apart from this, I have been a part of the Open Source Developer Community and has been an active contributor to [OpenPrinting](https://openprinting.github.io/). I also implemented the first open source conversion tool of the PCLm format, enabling printers low on RAM to print large PDFs via [Wifi-Direct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Direct). I am really passionate about helping budding students and have been a mentor in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) and [iie WeTech](https://www.iie.org/Programs/WeTech) mentorship programs.

Prior to my work at Amazon, I worked at Google, India, for about an year, proceeded by working at Goldman Sachs, India, for about 2.5 years.

I really like food, and sometimes I think that's one of the key purposes of my life. Although I find it hard to balance between eating less and staying fit. I workout a lot as well, and a bicycle is my primary mode of transport. My reading speed is a bit slow though, and I have recently started reading more to learn more about life in general. I recently finished the book: `Meditations` by Marcus Aurelies, and am currently reading `The Secret` by Rhonda Bryne and `Don't Lose your Mind, Lose your Weight` by Rujuta Diwekar.

This website was basically made to encapsulate my thoughts and share them with the internet. If you would like to reach out to me, feel free to reach out to me on: [n32z1c0lk@mozmail.com](mailto:n32z1c0lk@mozmail.com). See you on the other side! :-)
